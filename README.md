Right now the model_context_protocol_flat.py file needs work.  The server launches and then dies, I think when the process returns to the command line.  
Running my_mcp_server.py in one command (or preferably PowerShell) window will run the server.  Opening another window and launching my_mcp_client.py will dump out everything it finds on a given MCP server.
